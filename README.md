# Stock-Prediction-Model
Overview

The Stock Prediction Application is a machine learning-based system designed to analyze stock market trends and predict future stock prices. This application leverages historical stock data and applies predictive modeling techniques to provide insights into potential stock price movements.

Features

Historical Data Analysis: Processes past stock price data to identify trends and patterns.

Predictive Modeling: Uses machine learning algorithms to forecast stock prices.

Visualization: Generates graphical representations of stock trends and predictions.

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and normalizes data to improve model accuracy.

Technologies Used

Python: Core programming language for development.

Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.

NumPy: For numerical computations.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.

Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for predictive modeling.

TensorFlow/Keras (if applicable): For deep learning-based predictions.


Usage

Load the dataset containing historical stock prices.

Choose a stock symbol to analyze.

Run the predictive model to forecast future prices.

View the predictions and trend visualizations.

Future Improvements

Integrating real-time stock market data.

Enhancing prediction accuracy with deep learning models.

Developing a web-based or mobile interface for easier accessibility.
